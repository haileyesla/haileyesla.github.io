		<p>My name is Hailey Slaughter, and I am an English major with a literature emphasis at the University of Tennessee at Martin. 
		My minor is in Communications, and I will be graduating in May of 2020.
		 After graduation, I plan to obtain a master’s degree in library science and have a career as a librarian. 
		 I have always loved books and reading from a young age, and this love for reading is part of what inspired me to be an English major.
		  The library always felt like a second home to me as a child, and I volunteered at the Obion County Public Library in my hometown throughout high school, even after I started working there in 2014.
		   While in college, I was promoted to an assistant position in the children’s department, a job that I was very passionate about and loved dearly. 
		   Unfortunately, I had to leave at the beginning of the fall 2019 semester because of conflicts with classes and extracurriculars, but I gained valuable experience in my future field from my time there.
		    I learned that nothing makes me happier than watching a child’s eyes light up with enthusiasm about books and reading.
		     It warmed my heart when I would provide book suggestions, and the children would read what I suggested, coming back to the library the next week talking passionately about books.
		      It is my hope that although I no longer work at the library, I will one day be able to experience this again.</p>
		      
		<p>In my time at UTM, I have taken advantage of the many clubs and activities on campus. 
		I am a University Scholar, which means that I receive a scholarship every year and that I must complete a two-year research project. 
		I am currently working on this project in addition to my normal studies, and I will defend it in spring of 2020.
		 I am also involved with BeanSwitch, the literature and fine arts magazine on campus, and Sigma Tau Delta, the international English honors society. 
		 I am the current president of UTM’s chapter of Sigma Tau Delta. 
		 This semester, our chapter held an event in partnership with UTM’s Writing Center in celebration of Banned Books Week, and we have several other events and projects in the works such as a book drive for low-income schools.
		  In addition to involvement in the campus community, I have also received awards and recognitions while at UTM. 
		  In spring of 2019, I received the Outstanding English Major award at the annual Department of English and Modern Foreign Languages banquet, and one of my short stories was chosen to be sent to the Southern Literary Festival that semester as well. 
		  I have also gained experience in public speaking while at UTM from presenting my work at various conferences.
		   For the past two years, I have presented some of my academic papers at the Interdisciplinary Student Writing Conference held on campus,
		and last spring, I spoke on a panel with fellow UTM Writing Center student tutors at the Southeastern Writing Center Association Conference in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.</p>
